# MapRoutes

## Overview

MapRoutes is a project designed to visualize and manage routes on a map interface. It allows users to create, edit, and view routes interactively, making it useful for logistics, travel planning, or educational purposes.

## How It Works

- **Frontend:** The application uses a modern JavaScript framework (such as React or Vue) to render the map and user interface.
- **Map Integration:** It leverages mapping APIs (like Google Maps API or Leaflet) to display maps and handle route plotting.
- **Route Management:** Users can add waypoints, draw routes, and save or modify them as needed.
- **Backend (if applicable):** A backend server (Node.js/Express, Django, etc.) may be used to store route data and handle user authentication.

## Technologies Used

- JavaScript/TypeScript for frontend logic
- React or Vue for building the user interface
- Mapping library (Google Maps API, Leaflet, or Mapbox)
- CSS/SCSS for styling
- (Optional) Node.js/Express or Django for backend services
- (Optional) Database such as MongoDB or PostgreSQL
